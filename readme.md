# My pc setup

This repo contains my pc setup. This consists of:

- arch: setup with hyprland - `hyprland`, `kitty`, `waybar` and `wofi`
- dotfiles: all kinds of configs
- scripts: utils scripts and other progams.
- completitions: some scripts have compdef for autocompletion

## Install

Before anything, it is necessary to have zsh installed with oh-my-zsh. Some scripts have completions, that is why oh-my-zsh is needed because it makes all that process 10x easier.

To install it, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

If you already have that, install them by running `make`.

## About the scripts

Each scripts has its own documentation which you can access by passing `--help` or `-h`.
