# Collection of my PC util scripts

This repo contains all the util scripts I use on my systems.

## Install

Before anything, it is necessary to have zsh installed with oh-my-zsh. Some scripts have completions, that is why oh-my-zsh is needed because it makes all that process 10x easier.

To install it, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

If you already have that, install them by running `make`.

## About the scripts

Each scripts has its own documentation which you can access by passing `--help` or `-h`.
